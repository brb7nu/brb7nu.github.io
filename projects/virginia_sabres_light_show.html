<h1>Virginia Sabres Light Show</h1>

<h2>Fall 2015 in ECE 3430</h2>

<p>For my Embedded Systems Design class, my team created a light-up board that responded to the input volume of music. The design used the MSP430 to digitally filter the incoming analog audio and output a corresponding signal to the sequential rows of LEDs. These LEDs were arranged in the shape of the University of Virginia's Sabres logo. The row corresponding to the loudest signal was red, middle rows were yellow, and quiet rows were green.</p>
