<h1>Ghosthunter</h1>

<h2>Fall 2013 in CS 2110</h2>

<p>The final project for Software Development Methods was to create a Java app for Android. In a team of four, we created a game called Ghosthunter. The game would place ghosts that randomly walked around the user at nearby latidude-longitude points. If the player walked into any of these ghosts, a math problem would appear. Points were earned by solving the problem correctly.</p>
