<h1>Bedroom Loft</h1>

<h2>Summer 2015</h2>

<p>As a side project while interning during the summer of 2015, I designed and built two lofts for my apartment. I used Google SketchUp to model my bedroom so I could visualize the proportions and layout of the room. 3D modeling software was essential to my design process because I could only visit the unfurnished apartment a few times before moving in. The first time I checked it out in person, I used a tape measure and recorded the position of the key features in the room -- switches, doors, windows, and outlets. Then, I created the 3D model of the bare room. Once I had the environment modeled, I started experimenting with loft designs knowing confidently they would not cover an important outlet or conflict with the obtrusive trim below the window.</p>

<p>The first design was intended to maximize headroom below it. This was difficult because the ceiling was only 8'. I wanted to put my desk underneath so I could have more footroom in the rest of the bedroom. Construction was straightforward -- I used pine 2x4s and 2x6s for the frame and railing and some thinner boards for the cross beams that supported the plywood platform. I did not finish or stain the wood because I wasn't 100% committed to the design. Once the construction was complete, I disassembled it into three main parts so I could transport it from my home woodshop to my apartment. Despite the 3D planning, when I assembled the loft in the bedroom, the imposing 8' ceiling proved to be too claustrophobic. Even though the model helped with dimensions and layout, it wasn't able to convey the feeling of just how small 24" of clearance from the mattress to the ceiling is.</p>

<p>Luckily, the apartment is a duplex and the second floor rooms have taller ceilings. I moved the first loft upstairs to another bedroom where height was not a constraint. I then redesigned the loft so it would be shorter, sacrificing the ability to walk or use a desk beneath it. I also changed the cross beams to a dense sequence of 2x4s rather than thin boards and plywood because I wanted more rigitiy in the platform. Just as planned, V2 fit perfectly in the room and gave me more headroom so I could actually sit up in bed and not bang my head on the ceiling.</p>
