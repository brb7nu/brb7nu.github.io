<h1>Pedestrian Safety</h1>

<h2>Fall 2013 in ENGR 1620</h2>

<p>Our Introduction to Engineering class worked in teams with the main objective of improving pedestrian safety. The students designed and planned the entire project with some guidance from our professor. The main action involved testing different types of material for padding on the A-posts of cars. My smaller team took a systems approach, identifying alternative methods of improving pedestrian safety. One of these methods was to study the behavior of jaywalkers on UVa Grounds. We analyzed the timing of the crosswalk and stoplight at the intersection of Alderman Road and McCormick Road. From this, we were able to suggest that a grace period be added to the end of the walking countdown, allowing more time for lagging pedestrians to hussle across the street before cars are given the green light. A supplemental part of this project was a visit to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), where we observed crash tests and learned about crash safety.</p>
