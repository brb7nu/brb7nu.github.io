<h1>Music Desk</h1>

<h2>Summer 2014</h2>

<p>I designed and built a desk for music production and DJing. I did the initial plan using Google SketchUp, making a 3D model so I could have a visual in my mind of what the end product would look like. I browsed the Home Depot online catalog and selected birch plywood for the surfaces, maple hardwood for the legs and drawer, and an assortment of hardware for mounting the drawer. To build it, I set up a workbench in my garage, turning it into a woodshop. I worked on it when I had free time at home, and after about four weeks, the construction was done. I then finished the desk over the next couple weeks with two coats of dark mahogany oil stain and four coats of polyurethane to protect it and make it pretty. In total, the desk took about 100 hours of work, including the design phase.</p>
