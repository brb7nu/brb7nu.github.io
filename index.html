<h2>Benjamin R. Browning</h2>

<p>Hi! My name is Ben and I am currently studying computer engineering at the University of Virginia. I am enrolled in the Technology Leaders Program (TLP), an interdisciplinary curriculum in the School of Engineering and Applied Science that emphasizes depth in my specific major and breadth in knowledge across other fields too -- I'm majoring in Computer Engineering but I am also taking classes in mechanical, eletrical, and systems engineering through the TLP. The Technology Leaders Program was recently officially approved by the University as the official Design Integration Minor. Additionally, I am taking classes in the McIntire School of Commerce to pursue an Engineering Business Minor. I hope you enjoy my portfolio!</p>
